# Library App

The Library App is a Flutter application that utilizes Clean Architecture to display books and fetch them from the Google Books API. The app provides a smooth user interface for displaying all books, searching for specific books, and viewing the details of a particular book.

## Features

- **Display All Books**: Browse the available list of books.
- **Search for Books**: Search for books using keywords.
- **View Book Details**: View details of a particular book such as the description, author, etc.

## Application Infrastructure

The application follows the principles of Clean Architecture, meaning it is divided into three main layers:

- **Data Layer**: Deals with connecting to the Google Books API and managing data.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic and rules.
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles the user interface and the presentation of data.

## Installation

To install the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.
2. Open the folder in a Flutter development environment.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Run `flutter run` to start the application.
